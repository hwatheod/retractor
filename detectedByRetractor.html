<h2>Illegal positions detected by Retractor 2.0</h2>
<p>
	Retractor 2.0 catches all of the following illegal retractions. Note: In the following, a “pseudo-legal move” is a
    move that is legal only by virtue of reversing to a legal move for that piece in forward-play chess in terms of
    piece movement direction, and does not consider any other criterion for legality, including those involving checks.
<p>

    <ol>
    <li>Any move that is not pseudo-legal.</li>
    <li>Placing the opposing king in check.</li>
    <li>Placing the mover’s own king in check by 3 or more pieces.</li>
    <li>Placing the mover’s own king in double check, unless:</li>
    <ul>
        <li> One of the checking pieces can pseudo-legally move onto the line of the other without also giving check.</li>
	<li> One of the checking pieces is on the eighth rank, and can (pseudo-legally) unpromote onto the line of the other check without the resulting
        unpromoted pawn giving check.</li>
	<li> Of the two checking pieces, one is a vertical and the other a diagonal mover, and the checking pieces and king are
        positioned such that there is a pawn on the appropriate square to make an en passant uncapture that covers both checking
        lines simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Placing the mover’s own king in single check by a pawn that has no retreat square.</li>
    <li>Illegalities resulting from <a href="cages.html" target="_blank">cages</a>.</li>
    <li>Illegal pawn structures.</li>
<li>Count illegalities: too many captures, too many pawns, too many promoted pieces.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Promoted pieces deduced by Retractor 2.0</h3>
<ul>
    <li>pieces in excess of the original count (3 rooks, 2 dark-squared bishops, etc.)</li>
    <li>user-marked promoted pieces</li>
    <li>pieces deduced to be promoted as a result of a <a href="cages.html" target="_blank">cage</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Captures deduced by Retractor 2.0</h3>
<ul>
    <li>pawn captures</li>
    <li>captures of pieces from <a href="cages.html" target="_blank">cages</a></li>
</ul>
